# JavaScript Operators and Basics

This README provides an overview of a JavaScript program focusing on operators and basic concepts. It covers fundamental topics such as numbers, math methods, type casting, and conditionals. Let's explore the program:

- **Operators**
  - The program demonstrates various operations with numbers in JavaScript, including incrementing, decrementing, and arithmetic operations.
  - **Numbers in JavaScript**
    - The program initializes a variable `num1` with the value `10` and showcases operations such as incrementing by `1`, decrementing by `1`, and incrementing/decrementing by any specified number.

- **Math Methods**
  - The program introduces mathematical methods such as `Math.random()`, which generates a random number between `0` and `1`, `Math.floor()`, which rounds a number down to the nearest integer, and `Math.ceil()`, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

- **Casting**
  - The program prompts the user to input the cost of food and the tip percentage. It then calculates the tip amount and total amount, demonstrating type casting in JavaScript.

- **Baby Level Weather App (Conditionals)**
  - Finally, the program implements a simple weather app using conditionals. It prompts the user to input the weather condition and advises whether to grab an umbrella or wear sunglasses based on the input.
