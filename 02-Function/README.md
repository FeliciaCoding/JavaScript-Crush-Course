This README provides insights into different types of functions and array methods in JavaScript, showcasing their usage and benefits.


## Function Definitions

1. **Function with 0 arguments**
   - This function logs the name "Felicia" to the console.

2. **Function with 1 argument**
   - Utilizes template literals to create a greeting message with the provided name.

## ES6 Arrow Function

- They offer benefits such as implicit return and shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

## Array Methods
